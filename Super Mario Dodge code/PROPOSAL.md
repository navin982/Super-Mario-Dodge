# What is the project?
For my final project I plan on making a 2D game involving a character dodging obstacles. 
It will have a main menu with some options, 
including a play button. There will be many sounds
incorporated into the game (such as death, move, etc.). 
If the character touches the obstacle than the game will end. 
As of right now the plan is for the player to move around to 
dodge incoming obstacles. 

# Libraries/Resources Needed
1. I plan on heavy use of the sound 
library (**ofSoundPlayer**) for various sound effects.
1. **ofXGui** is needed for user interfaces and menu's.
1. I plan on using **ofTrueTypeFont** to display text 
1. **ofImage** to display pictures
